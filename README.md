# AxolotlMint
A simple minting site to test web3 technologies and practices

## THINGS I LEARNED
* How to write smart contracts.
* How you can use web3 apis to interact with those contracts and affect the state of the blockchain
* Generating hundreds of NFT images with JSON data including rarity, attributes, etc.
* Upload and fetch data to IPFS

# NOTE
This code isn't uploaded to the blockchain as I am too broke to pay gas fees :(
